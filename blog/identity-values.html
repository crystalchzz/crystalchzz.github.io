        <h2>Values is <strong>T</strong>hinking</h2>
        <p>
          As a Thinker, i'm driven by a desire to pursue rational, logical
          reasoning. I tend to think about things in a detached, unemotional
          manner, and are most comfortable when I can reason through an issue
          logically. 
          <br><br>   I'm are disinterested in personal appeals, preferring my
          decisions to be objective.I can be competitive with others, and don't
          mind ruffling a few feathers to achieve My goals.

          <p>Core Values:</p>

        <h2>My Personality Type</h2>
        <p>
            I'm an energized by challenge and are often inspired by a problem that others perceive as impossible to solve. I rely on ingenuity to deal with the world around me, and rarely find preparation necessary. I will often jump into a new situation and trust that i will adapt as we go. 
          <br><br>   I enjoy playing with ideas and especially like to banter with others. I use your quick wit and command of language to keep the upper hand with other people, often cheerfully poking fun at their habits and eccentricities. While I enjoy challenging others, in the end usually happy to live and let live. I rarely judgmental, but you may have little patience for people who can't keep up.

          
          <ul class="value">
            <li>Confronting challenges</li>
            <li>Finding innovative solutions</li>
            <li>Imagining new possibilities</li>
            <li>Analyzing issues and ideas</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>How Others See Me</h2>
        <p>
          I'm friendly and usually want to be seen as clever and may try to impress others with some quick wit and incisive humor.  I'm curious about the world around, and want to know how things work. For myself, however, the rules of the universe are made to be broken.
          <br><br> I like to find the loopholes and figure out how can i work the system to my advantage. This is not to say that i'm malicious; it just simply find rules limiting, and believe there is probably a better, faster, or more interesting way to do things that hasnâ€™t been thought of before.
