        <p>
          As a Thinker, i'm driven by a desire to pursue rational, logical
          reasoning. I tend to think about things in a detached, unemotional
          manner, and are most comfortable when I can reason through an issue
          logically. 
          <br><br>   I'm are disinterested in personal appeals, preferring my
          decisions to be objective.I can be competitive with others, and don't
          mind ruffling a few feathers to achieve My goals.

        <h2>My Personality Type</h2>
        <p>
            I'm an energized by challenge and are often inspired by a problem that others perceive as impossible to solve. I rely on ingenuity to deal with the world around me, and rarely find preparation necessary. I will often jump into a new situation and trust that i will adapt as we go. 
          <br><br>   I enjoy playing with ideas and especially like to banter with others. I use your quick wit and command of language to keep the upper hand with other people, often cheerfully poking fun at their habits and eccentricities. While I enjoy challenging others, in the end usually happy to live and let live. I rarely judgmental, but you may have little patience for people who can't keep up.

          
          <ul class="value">
            <li>Confronting challenges</li>
            <li>Finding innovative solutions</li>
            <li>Imagining new possibilities</li>
            <li>Analyzing issues and ideas</li>
            </ul>
