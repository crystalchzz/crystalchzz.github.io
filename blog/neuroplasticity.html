        <h2><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>Research Neuroplasticity</h2>
        <h3>There are many benefits of brain neuroplasticity. It allows your brain to adapt and change, which helps promote:</h3>
      
         

            <ul class="value">
              <li>The ability to learn new things</li>
              <li>The ability to enhance your existing cognitive capabilities</li>
              <li>Recovery from strokes and traumatic brain injuries</li>
              <li>Strengthening areas if some functions are lost or decline</li>
              <li>Improvements that can promote brain fitness </li>
            
            </ul>
         
        </p>
        <h2><i class="fas fa-thumbs-up"></i>Neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
        <p>
            It will help me learn coding in any new programming language now and in the future. It will increase my confidence when encountering difficulties, such as solving problems and fixing errors.
          <br />

        </p>
        <h2><i class="fas fa-sort-amount-up"></i>Increase your neuroplasticity</h2>

        <h3>Rewiring your brain might sound pretty complicated, but it's absolutely something you can do at home.</h3>
        
        <p>
        <ul class="n-value">

       <li>Play video games or any game… you name it you play it. </li>
       <li> Learn a new language or simply expand your vocabulary by learn one new word every day</li>
       <li> Make some music or learn an instrument... You can try to create music about learning to code... Wait... It may hurt your ears, but our coding nerves are still very HIGH!</li>
       <li> Travel - Traveling promotes neurogenesis by exposing your brain to new and complex environments. </li>
       <li> Exercise or take a nap, most human being tend to do both.  A short afternoon nap of around 20 minutes will elevate your neuroplasticity potential even further</li>
       <li> Make art - Whether it's creating mosaics, jewellery, pottery, painting, or drawing, the combination of motor and cognitive processing will promote better brain connectivity.</li>
       </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-seedling"></i>Research Growth Mindset</h2>
        <p>
            Having a growth mindset (the belief that you are in control of your own ability, and can learn and improve) is the key to success. Yes, hard work, effort, and persistence are all important, but not as important as having that underlying belief that you are in control of your own destiny.
      
        </p>

        <p>It actually helped my self-confidence, simply relieved the pressure of feeling not smart enough at some point, It helped me evolve from just trying to keep an open mind, which is not enough. The brain needs more than ever. I believe I can do this by working hard.

        </p><br>

        <h3>Practice behaviours to strength your beliefs , for example: </h3>
        <div class="n_p">
                <ul class="value">
                    <li>“I can always improve at something if I try.”</li>
        You don’t give up at the first sign of weakness. Rather, you believe that the more effort you put into something, the better you will become.

        <li>I learn my work after other who have been successful in the past </li>

        Instead of being jealous of that person’s success, you’re interested in their work–that’s showing a growth mindset.

        <li>“What can I do better next time to make this work?”</li>

        It’s about being able to analyze where you went wrong and determine how you can do different things next time. This is a potential improvement.

        <li>“I am at the starting point of my potential.”</li>

        You recognize that everyone starts at the beginning and there is a learning curve to every new skill.

        <li>“This challenge is a good opportunity for me to learn.”</li>

        The more you challenge yourself, the more opportunities you will have to learn because each new challenge presents a new opportunity to gain experience and knowledge.

        <li>“Effort makes me stronger.”</li>

        any effort you put toward improving yourself will make you stronger.

        <li>“I can’t do that…yet.”</li>

        Having a growth mindset means believing that you can eventually learn to do anything.
    </ul>

        <h2><i class="fas fa-braille"></i>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
        <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.</h3>
        <p>
         You can change your mindset from a fixed mindset to a mindset that is willing and able to grow. The first step is to identify your fixed thinking tendencies and beliefs and correct them. 
        </p><br>
        <p>Your mentality will ultimately affect your actions and behaviors, especially in terms of learning. This is the first step to becoming better in life.</p><br>
        <p>Next time when my inner voice tells me that I am not smart enough to do the work, I will use the example given above to change my mind. If you think you can do it and try to do it, nothing can limit you</p>
        <h3 class="n-h3">If I believe that I can better resist being a better time manager and resist all the distractions in learning, then I will be able to grow faster and better in my course.</h3>
