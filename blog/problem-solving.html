          <h3>
            Problem solving is a key skill you will utilise as a developer. Here
            are some problem solving techniques you can try today:
          </h3>

          <h3 class="center-h3">Improving your process with reflection:</h3>

          <p>
            Reflecting on what you have learned will make the experience more
            effective. Reflection builds a person's confidence in the ability to
            achieve goals (ie self-efficacy), which in turn translates into a
            higher learning rate. This kind of reflective comments on the code
            will help us (mentors and students) to improve our problem-solving
            skills. If we do not reflect or simply describe our activities, we
            will never gain insights that will help us become better learners.
            It allows learners to think deeply about the process and realize how
            they make decisions and learn. If every time I solve a challenge, I
            can better understand my thought process and tendencies, I will
            become a better learner. When I become a better learner, I will
            develop better solutions.

        <h2>
          <i class="fab fa-sistrix"></i>The Importance of Code Readability
        </h2>
        <p>
          1. Readable code is simply code that clearly communicates its intent
          to the reader. most likely, the code we write will be read by other
          developers, who will either want to understand or modify the way our
          code works. they may need to test the code, fix a problem, or add a
          new feature.
          <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          2. These other developers reading our code could be our teammates, a
          consultant, a new junior developer, or even developers from another
          company who are programming a specific portion of the application. and
          more importantly, that developer could be ourselves, when we revisit
          our own code.
          <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          3. We’ll want to make it easier to work with this shared code. to do
          this, we’ll have to make sure that everyone involved, including
          ourselves, understands the same thing easily and quickly. code that is
          readable for one person is not necessarily readable for another.
          <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          4. Code that is not readable takes more time to understand and can
          make us lose a lot of time on what should be a simple task. the
          worst-case scenario is that it could even take several iterations to
          fix some problems. in some cases, we might spend so much time trying
          to understand code that we might want to rewrite it completely.
          <br /><br />
        </p>
        <p>
          5. Furthermore, by not understanding the code well, we may
          misinterpret its use and by modifying the code, we may unintentionally
          create new problems. code that is not easily readable can therefore
          increase the risk of defects. at direct impact, we believe that the
          benefits of readable code win over quickly produced code that may
          contain more errors.
          <br /><br />
        </p>

          In order to produce good readable code, Developer will have to follow
          good coding practices:
